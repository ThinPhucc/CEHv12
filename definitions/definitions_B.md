# Definitions B

## Backdoor
A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a "homunculus computer" —a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology).

## Background Check
A background check is a process a person or company uses to verify that an individual is who they claim to be, and this provides an opportunity to check and confirm the validity of someone's criminal record, education, employment history, and other activities from their past.

## Bandwith
In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.
Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.

## Bandwith Throttling
Bandwidth throttling consists in the intentional limitation of the communication speed (bytes or kilobytes per second) of the ingoing (received) data and/or in the limitation of the speed of outgoing (sent) data in a network node or in a network device.

## Banner Grabbing
Banner grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. Administrators can use this to take inventory of the systems and services on their network. However, an intruder can use banner grabbing in order to find network hosts that are running versions of applications and operating systems with known exploits.

An example of banner grabbing is provided below
```shell
telnet ceh.a3cipher.com
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
```

## Base64
In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data (more specifically, a sequence of 8-bit bytes) in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.

## BeEF
BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework.
It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser.

## Birthday Attack
A birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory.
This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties.
The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (pigeonholes).

## Block Chain
A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.

## Block Cipher Mode of Operation
In cryptography, a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security such as confidentiality or authenticity.

### Electronic code book mode
The simplest (and not to be used anymore) of the encryption modes is the electronic codebook (ECB) mode (named after conventional physical codebooks).
The message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.

### Public blockchain
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions.
Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).
Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

### Private blockchain
A private blockchain is permissioned.
One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators.
Participant and validator access is restricted.
To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.

## BlueBorne
BlueBorne is a type of security vulnerability with Bluetooth implementations in Android, iOS, Linux and Windows.
It affects many electronic devices such as laptops, smart cars, smartphones and wearable gadgets.

## Border Gateway Protocol
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.[1] BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol,[2] and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.

## Botnet
> A botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots.
> Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection.

## Bring Your Own Device
Bring your own device (BYOD /ˌbiː waɪ oʊ ˈdiː/)—also called bring your own technology (BYOT), bring your own phone (BYOP), and bring your own personal computer (BYOPC)—refers to being allowed to use one's personally owned device, rather than being required to use an officially provided device.

## Brute Force Attack
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.

## Buffer Overflow
In information security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly whereby a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations.

## Bug Bounty Program
A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation[1][2] for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.
