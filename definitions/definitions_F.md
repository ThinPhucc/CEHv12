## Footprinting
Footprinting (also known as reconnaissance) is the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to.

### Passive footprinting
Passive Footprinting is the process of gathering information on a target by innocuous, or, passive, means.

### Active footprinting
Active Footprinting is the process of using tools and techniques, such as performing a ping sweep or using the traceroute command, to gather information on a target.

## Federal Information Security Modernization Act
The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA 2014) updates the Federal Government's cybersecurity practices by:
- Codifying Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority to administer the implementation of information security policies for non-national security federal Executive Branch systems, including providing technical assistance and deploying technologies to such systems;
- Amending and clarifying the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) oversight authority over federal agency information security practices; and by
- Requiring OMB to amend or revise OMB A-130 to "eliminate inefficient and wasteful reporting."

## File Transfer Protocol
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

## Fileless Malware
Fileless malware is a variant of computer related malicious software that exists exclusively as a computer memory-based artifact i.e. in RAM.
It does not write any part of its activity to the computer's hard drive, thus increasing its ability to evade antivirus software that incorporate file-based whitelisting, signature detection, hardware verification, pattern-analysis, time-stamping, etc., and leaving very little evidence that could be used by digital forensic investigators to identify illegitimate activity.

## File Inclusion Vulnerability
A file inclusion vulnerability is a type of web vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time.
This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time.

## Firewalking
Firewalking is a technique developed by Mike Schiffman and David Goldsmith that utilizes traceroute techniques and TTL values to analyze IP packet responses in order to determine gateway ACL (Access Control List) filters and map networks.
It is an active reconnaissance network security analysis technique that attempts to determine which layer 4 protocols a specific firewall will allow.

## Firewall
In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.

## Fog Computing
Fog computing or fog networking, also known as fogging, is an architecture that uses edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of computation (edge computing), storage, and communication locally and routed over the Internet backbone.

## Frequency Analysis
In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis (also known as counting letters) is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.
The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.

## Fuzzing
In programming and software development, fuzzing or fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.
