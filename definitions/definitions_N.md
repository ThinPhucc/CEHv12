# Defintions N

## National Institute of Standards and Technology
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an agency of the United States Department of Commerce whose mission is to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness.
NIST's activities are organized into physical science laboratory programs that include nanoscale science and technology, engineering, information technology, neutron research, material measurement, and physical measurement.

## National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).
This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance.
The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security-related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

## NetBIOS
NetBIOS (/ˈnɛtbaɪɒs/) is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System.
It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network.
As strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol.

`Nbtstat`
Nbstat is a utility that displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which helps troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution issues.

`PsExec` can be used to interact with NetBIOS.

## Netcat
netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.
The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.

## Network Access Control
Network access control (NAC) is an approach to computer security that attempts to unify endpoint security technology (such as antivirus, host intrusion prevention, and vulnerability assessment), user or system authentication and network security enforcement.

## Network Address Translation
Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

## Network File System
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984,[1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.

## Network Interface Card
A network interface controller (NIC, also known as a network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter or physical network interface, and by similar terms) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.

## Network Segmentation
A network segment is a portion of a computer network.
The nature and extent of a segment depends on the nature of the network and the device or devices used to interconnect end stations.

## Network Sniffing Attack
Sniffing attack in context of network security, corresponds to theft or interception of data by capturing the network traffic using a packet sniffer (an application aimed at capturing network packets). When data is transmitted across networks, if the data packets are not encrypted, the data within the network packet can be read using a sniffer.

## Network Time Protocol
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.
In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.
NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.
Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.

## nmap
Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon.
Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

## Non-repudiation
In law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract.
It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.

## Null Byte
The null character (also null terminator) is a control character with the value zero.
It is present in many character sets, including those defined by the Baudot and ITA2 codes, ISO/IEC 646 (or ASCII), the C0 control code, the Universal Coded Character Set (or Unicode), and EBCDIC.
It is available in nearly all mainstream programming languages. 
A null character can be placed in a URL with the percent code %00.
