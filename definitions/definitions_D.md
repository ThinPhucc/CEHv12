## Default Credentials
A Default Credential vulnerability is a type of vulnerability in a computing device that most commonly affects devices having some pre-set (default) administrative credentials to access all configuration settings.
The vendor or manufacturer of such devices uses a single pre-defined set of admin credentials to access the device configurations, and any potential hacker can misuse this fact to hack such devices, if those credentials are not changed by consumers.

## Defense in Depth
Defense in depth is a concept used in information security in which multiple layers of security controls (defense) are placed throughout an information technology (IT) system.
Its intent is to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited that can cover aspects of personnel, procedural, technical and physical security for the duration of the system's life cycle.

## Distributed Control System
A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerised control system for a process or plant usually with many control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is no central operator supervisory control.
This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer.

## Distributed Denial of Service Attack
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers.
A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware.

## Domain Name System Amplification
DNS amplification is a DDoS attack that leverages DNS resolvers to overwhelm a victim with traffic.

## Domain Name System Hijacking
DNS hijacking, DNS poisoning, or DNS redirection is the practice of subverting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) queries.
This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.

## Domain Name System Security Extensions
The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

The original design of the Domain Name System did not include any security features. It was conceived only as a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempt to add security, while maintaining backward compatibility. Request for Comments 3833 documents some of the known threats to the DNS, and their solutions in DNSSEC.

## Domain Name System Spoofing
DNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address.
This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture.

### Rogue DHCP server
A rogue DHCP server is a DHCP server on a network which is not under the administrative control of the network staff.
It is a network device such as a modem or a router connected to the network by a user who may be either unaware of the consequences of their actions or may be knowingly using it for network attacks such as man in the middle.

## Dynamic ARP Inspection
Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) is a security feature that rejects invalid and malicious ARP packets.
The feature prevents a class of man-in-the-middle attacks, where an unfriendly station intercepts traffic for other stations by poisoning the ARP caches of its unsuspecting neighbors.
The miscreant sends ARP requests or responses mapping another stationâ€™s IP address to its own MAC address.

DAI relies on DHCP snooping.
DHCP snooping listens to DHCP message exchanges and builds a bindings database of valid tuples (MAC address, IP address, VLAN interface).
