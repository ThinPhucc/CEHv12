## Wardriving
Wardriving is the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks, usually from a moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone.
Software for wardriving is freely available on the internet.

## Watering Hole Attack
Watering hole is a computer attack strategy in which an attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization often uses and infects one or more of them with malware.
Eventually, some member of the targeted group will become infected.

## Webhook
A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks.
These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application.

## Website Defacement
Website defacement is an attack on a website that changes the visual appearance of a website or a web page.
These are typically the work of defacers, who break into a web server and replace the hosted website with one of their own.

## Website Mirroring
Mirror sites or mirrors are replicas of other websites or any network node.
The concept of mirroring applies to network services accessible through any protocol, such as HTTP or FTP.
Such sites have different URLs than the original site, but host identical or near-identical content.

## Web Application
A web application (or web app) is application software that is accessed using a web browser.
Web applications are delivered on the World Wide Web to users with an active network connection.

## Web Application Firewall
A web application firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service.
By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application's known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.

## Web Cache Poisoning
In a vulnerable application, threat actors inject specially crafted data into cache memory, causing the webserver to respond with a malicious HTTP response to the user.

## Web of Trust
n cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner.
Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such).

## Web Server
A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.
A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.

## Web Shell
A web shell is a shell-like interface that enables a web server to be remotely accessed, often for the purposes of cyberattacks.
A web shell is unique in that a web browser is used to interact with it.

## Web Spider
A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

## Whitelist Validation
Whitelist validation is the practice of only accepting input that is known to be good.

## Whois
WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or an autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of other information.

## Wi-fi Protected Access
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) are the three security and security certification programs developed after 2000 by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.
The Alliance defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

## Wired Equivalent Privacy
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was a security algorithm for 802.11 wireless networks.
Introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network

## Wireless
Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer.

## Wireless Access Point
In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP), or more generally just access point (AP), is a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.
As a standalone device, the AP may have a wired connection to a router, but, in a wireless router, it can also be an integral component of the router itself.

## Wireshark
Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer.
It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions.
Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.

## Wiretapping
Telephone tapping (also wire tapping or wiretapping in American English) is the monitoring of telephone and Internet-based conversations by a third party, often by covert means.

## Worm
A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.
It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it.
