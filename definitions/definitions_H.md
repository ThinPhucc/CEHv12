## Hacker
A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.

- White hat hacker: White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated.
- Black hat hacker: Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain.
- Grey hat: A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

## Hashcat
Hashcat is a password recovery tool.
It had a proprietary code base until 2015, but was then released as open source software.

## Hash Collision Attack
In cryptography, a collision attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision.
This is in contrast to a preimage attack where a specific target hash value is specified.

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA or the Kennedyâ€“Kassebaum Act) is a United States Act of Congress enacted by the 104th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 21, 1996.
It modernized the flow of healthcare information, stipulates how personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage.

## Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space.
Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality.

## Honeypot
In computer terminology, a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems.
Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site which contains information or resources of value to attackers.

## Hotfix
A hotfix or quick-fix engineering update (QFE update) is a single, cumulative package that includes information (often in the form of one or more files) that is used to address a problem in a software product (i.e., a software bug).
Typically, hotfixes are made to address a specific customer situation.

## Hping3
hping3 is a network tool able to send custom ICMP/UDP/TCP packets and to display target replies like ping does with ICMP replies.
It handles fragmentation and arbitrary packet body and size, and can be used to transfer files under supported protocols.

## Hydra
Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack.
It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Response Splitting
HTTP response splitting is a form of web application vulnerability, resulting from the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values.
It can be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning, and similar exploits.

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.
In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.
