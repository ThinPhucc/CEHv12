# Definitions A

## Acceptable Use Policy
An acceptable use policy (AUP), acceptable usage policy or fair use policy is a set of rules applied by the owner, creator or administrator of a computer network website, or service.
That restricts the ways in which the network, website or system may be used and sets guidelines as to how it should be used.
AUP documents are written for corporations, businesses, universities, schools, internet service providers (ISPs),[4] and website owners,[5] often to reduce the potential for legal action that may be taken by a user, and often with little prospect of enforcement.

## Address Resolution Protocol
The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.

## Address Resolution Protocol Spoofing
In computer networking, ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network.

## Advanced Encryption Standard

## Advanced Persistent Threat
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.
In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.

## ALTEr Attack
In aLTEr attack, an attacker pretends to be a real cell tower to the victim, while at the same time also pretending to be the victim to the real network, and then intercepts the communications between the victim and the real network.
