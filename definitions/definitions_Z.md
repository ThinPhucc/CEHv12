## Zero day
A zero-day (also known as a 0-day) is a computer-software vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software.
Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.
An exploit taking advantage of a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.
