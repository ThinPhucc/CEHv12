## Sarbanes–Oxley Act
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 is a United States federal law that mandates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for corporations. The law was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom. The sections of the bill cover responsibilities of a public corporation's board of directors, add criminal penalties for certain misconduct, and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to create regulations to define how public corporations are to comply with the law.

## Session Identifier
In computer science, a session identifier, session ID or session token is a piece of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges.
Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP.

## Simple Object Access Protocol
SOAP (formerly a backronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

## Slowloris Attack
Slowloris is a type of denial of service attack tool which allows a single machine to take down another machine's web server with minimal bandwidth and side effects on unrelated services and ports.
Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible.
It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request.
Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to, but never completing, the request.
Affected servers will keep these connections open, filling their maximum concurrent connection pool, eventually denying additional connection attempts from clients.

## Static Application Security Testing
Static application security testing (SAST) is used to secure software by reviewing the source code of the software to identify sources of vulnerabilities.
Although the process of statically analyzing the source code has existed as long as computers have existed, the technique spread to security in the late 90s and the first public discussion of SQL injection in 1998 when Web applications integrated new technologies like JavaScript and Flash.

## Structured Query Language
Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL,(/ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel", /ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (listen) S-Q-L; )[4][5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

## Structured Query Language Injection
In computing, SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

### Error based SQLi
The attacker performs actions that cause the database to produce error messages.
The attacker can potentially use the data provided by these error messages to gather information about the structure of the database.

### Union based SQLi
This technique takes advantage of the UNION SQL operator, which fuses multiple select statements generated by the database to get a single HTTP response.
This response may contain data that can be leveraged by the attacker.

### Boolean based SQLi
That attacker sends a SQL query to the database prompting the application to return a result.
The result will vary depending on whether the query is true or false.
Based on the result, the information within the HTTP response will modify or stay unchanged.
The attacker can then work out if the message generated a true or false result.

### Time based SQLi
Attacker sends a SQL query to the database, which makes the database wait (for a period in seconds) before it can react.
The attacker can see from the time the database takes to respond, whether a query is true or false.
Based on the result, an HTTP response will be generated instantly or after a waiting period.

## SYN Flood Attack
A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection.
The server has to spend resources waiting for half-opened connections, which can consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.
