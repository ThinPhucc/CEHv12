## Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private conversation or communications of others without their consent in order to gather information.

## Edge Computing
Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data.
This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.

## Elicitation
An elicitation technique is any of a number of data collection techniques used in anthropology, cognitive science, counseling, education, knowledge engineering, linguistics, management, philosophy, psychology, or other fields to gather knowledge or information from people.

## Encoding
Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers.

## Encryption
In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information.
This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext.
Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.

### Symmetric encryption
Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.
 
### Assymetric encryption
Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys.
Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key.

### Homomorphic encryption
Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it.

## Enumeration
Enumeration is defined as the process of extracting user names, machine names, network resources, shares and services from a system.

## Evil Twin
An evil twin is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.
The evil twin is the wireless LAN equivalent of the phishing scam.

## Exiftool
ExifTool is a free and open-source software program for reading, writing, and manipulating image, audio, video, and PDF metadata.
It is platform independent, available as both a Perl library (Image::ExifTool) and command-line application.

## Exploit
An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to oneâ€™s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized).

## Exploit DB
The Exploit Database is an archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers.

## Extensible Markup Language
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data.
It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

### XML external entity attack
XML External Entity attack (XXE attack) is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input.
This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.
This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service (DoS), server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.
