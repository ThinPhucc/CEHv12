## One Time Pad
In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent.
In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad).
