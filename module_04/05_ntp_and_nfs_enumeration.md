`ntpdate`

ntpdate is a computer program used to quickly synchronize and set computers' date and time by querying a Network Time Protocol server.

`ntptrace`

ntptrace determines where a given Network Time Protocol (NTP) server gets its time from, and follows the chain of NTP servers back to their master time source.

`showmount`

showmount queries the mount daemon on a remote host for information about the state of the NFS server on that machine.
