## LDAP Enumeration
`ldap3` (Python)

ldap3 is a pure Python LDAP 3 client library strictly conforming to RFC4510 and is released under the LGPL v3 open source license.
RFC4510 is the current LDAP specification (June 2006) from IETF and obsoletes the previous LDAP RFCs 2251, 2830, 3771 (December 1997).

`ldap-brute` (nmap)

Attempts to brute-force LDAP authentication.
By default it uses the built-in username and password lists.
In order to use your own lists use the userdb and passdb script arguments.
