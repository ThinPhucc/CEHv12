> The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is one of Nmap's most powerful and flexible features.
> It allows users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks.
> Those scripts are then executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap.
> Users can rely on the growing and diverse set of scripts distributed with Nmap, or write their own to meet custom needs.
